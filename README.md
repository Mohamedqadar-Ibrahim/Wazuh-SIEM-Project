# Wazuh SIEM Project üöÄ

## Overview üìñ
This project demonstrates the implementation of Wazuh, an open-source security information and event management (SIEM) tool, to monitor and analyze security events from a Windows virtual machine. The primary objective is to showcase the ability to detect and respond to potential security threats through log monitoring.

## Objective üéØ
The main objectives of this project are to:

| Objectives                                              |
|--------------------------------------------------------|
| Set up Wazuh to monitor a Windows VM for security events. |
| Configure a Wazuh agent on the Windows VM to send logs to Wazuh. |
| Trigger alerts in Wazuh by clearing Windows event logs and analyze them. |

## Tools Used üõ†Ô∏è
- **Wazuh**: Security monitoring and event management platform.
- **Windows Virtual Machine**: The monitored environment.
